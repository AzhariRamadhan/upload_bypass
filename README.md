# About

**Upload_Bypass** is a powerful tool designed to assist Pentesters and Bug Hunters in testing file upload mechanisms. It leverages various bug bounty techniques to simplify the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, ensuring thorough assessments of web applications.

### ðŸš€ Updates
- The code almost written from scratch, which now utilizes better file parsing and eliminates most of the bugs.
- Modular code! Now you can contribute to the code and add your own modules.
- Introducing 3 different modes, detection, exploitation and anti_malware check, choose your weapon!
- New state feature, you can now pause the code and resume from where you left off!
- New UI for an easy view.
- Docker file for an easy deployment.
- Various test files provided for internal testing.
- Debug mode. If you encounter a bug, you can save the stack trace and share it with me for further analysis.

# Features 
### Detection Mode:
   Suitable for real-world penetration tests or exams, such as the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional). This mode will upload harmless files and will not attempt to exploit the target.
### Exploitation Mode:
   Suitable when you want to exploit the target and upload an interactive Web-Shell (If an upload directory is provided), it will upload the file with a random UUID, so it will be harder for fuzzers to guess.    
### Eicar mode:
   Suitable for an Anti-Malware presence test. Upload an Eicar(Anti-Malware test file) to the system, and if the user specifies the location of the uploaded file, the tool will check if the file uploaded successfully and exists in the system in order to determine if an Anti-Malware is present on the system. 

# Customisation

###
Check out config.py in lib directory, you can add new extensions, mimetypes, magicbytes, configure your HTTP method and etc'...
###
To add a new module, simply add a function with your desired functionality to modules.py then add the function by name into the list "active_modules" in config.py
###
To add a new file extension, add a sample.{ext} file to assets/sample_files, then add the extension and its mimetype/magic bytes to config.py

  -v, --version  Print version

Required Arguments: 
  -r, --request_file <REQUEST_FILE>    Provide a request file to be proccessed
  -E, --extension    <EXTENSION>       Forbidden extension to check (ex: php)

  Choose only one from the options below:
  -s, --success      <MESSAGE>         Provide a failure message when a file is uploaded (ex: File was uploaded successfully)

# Examples
  ### Detection mode
     python upload_bypass.py -r test -s 'File uploaded successfully' -E php -D /uploads --burp --detect
  ### Exploitation mode
     python upload_bypass.py -r test -s 'File uploaded successfully' -E php -D /uploads --burp --exploit

# Issues
#### If you encounter an issue, please use the debug mode with a flag of 2 and share it with me. If the file you are working with is sensitive, use flag of 1.

# Contribution
#### If you would like to contirute to my code, please specify exactly what you added to the code and why, and make sure you performed multiple tests.
