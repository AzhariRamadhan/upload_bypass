# Features 
    1. Webshell mode:
       The tool will try to upload a Webshell with a random name, and if the user specifies the location of the uploaded file, the tool enters an "Interactive shell".
    2. Eicar mode:
       The tool will try to upload an Eicar(Anti-Malware test file) instead of a Webshell, and if the user specifies the location of the uploaded file, the tool will check if the file 
       uploaded successfully and exists in the system in order to determine if an Anti-Malware is present on the system. 
    3. A directory with the name of the tested host will be created in the Tool's directory upon success, with the results saved in Excel and Text files.
  
# Installation:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
# Usage:

## ***Attension***

The Tool is compatible exclusively with output file requests generated by Burp Suite.

Before saving the Burp file, replace the file content with the string \*content\* and filename.ext with the string \*filename\* and Content-Type header with \*mimetype\*(only if the tool is not able to recognize it automatically).

How a request should look before the changes:

How it should look after the changes:

If the tool fails to recognize the mime type automatically, you can add \*mimetype\* in the parameter's value of the Content-Type header.

# Examples
  ### Running the tool with Eicar and Bruteforce mode along with a verbose output     
     python upload_bypass.py -b ~/Desktop/burp_output -s 'file upload successfully!' -e php -a jpeg --response -v --eicar --continue
  ### Running the tool with Webshell mode along with a verbose output     
     python upload_bypass.py -b ~/Desktop/burp_output -s 'file upload successfully!' -e asp -a zip -v
  ### Running the tool with a Proxy client   
     python upload_bypass.py -b ~/Desktop/burp_output -s 'file upload successfully!' -e jsp -a png -v --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
